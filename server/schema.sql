-- Measurements don't have a unique primary key. Enforcing that the combination of

-- but could also incorrectly discard measurements that are actually different.
-- Instead, the server should store everything it receives and duplicates should be
-- filtered out during processing. Due to the missing primary key, the keyset pagination
-- can result in duplicates. We accept this trade-off in favor of performance.
-- If this ever becomes a problem, we can generate a column that reliably makes the
-- combination unique and use that for the keyset pagination. This way, we can
-- continue to do without an index. The same ideas apply to the logs table.
