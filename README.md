# Hermes - Driving The ACROPOLIS Network

Hermes is a management software for autonomous sensor networks. 

It consists of three parts: The sensor system, the server, and the dashboard.

The systems run autonomously and communicate with the server via MQTT. The server stores the data in a database and provides a REST API for data download and the dashboard.
