Hermes is a management software for autonomous sensor networks. 

It consists of three parts: The sensor system, the server, and the dashboard.

The systems run autonomously and communicate with the server via MQTT. The server stores the data in a database and provides a REST API for data download and the dashboard.

<br/>

## ðŸŽ¯ Main goals

1. Observe system status and measurements in real-time
2. Update the system configuration remotely
3. Update the system software remotely
4. Easy setup and deployment of Hermes Infrastructure

<br/>

## ðŸ“¦ Practical usage

This software is developed for the ACROPOLIS network. The goal of ACROPOLIS is to measure CO2 concentrations in the city of Munich. The network spans 20 roof-top systems.
